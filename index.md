<p style="text-align: center;">Hello everyone! I am proud to say that I am now a Florida State University graduate. I have recently earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science along with a Minor in Mathematics.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am well-versed in multiple coding languages including C, C++, Java, HTML/CSS, and Python. With these languages, I have built a strong background in Object-Oriented Programming and have used multiple tech stacks including Android Studio, MySQL, Django, and Angular/Node.js<br /><br />My favorite hobbies outside of work involve spending time with my friends, girlfriend, family, and dog. I love to play video games as well as spending time at the gym. I also love keeping up to date with world news, cryptocurrencies, and the latest tv-shows!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> Currently working at TCS as a Java Full Stack Software Engineer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. :-)</p>
