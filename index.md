<p style="text-align: center;">Hey there, everyone! I'm super excited to share that I graduated from Florida State University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics—go Noles!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I've actually mastered a bunch of coding languages like C++, Javascript, Java, HTML/CSS, and Python. I've used this skill set to get hands-on with Object-Oriented Programming and work with cool tech stacks, including Android Studio, MySQL, Django, Angular/Node.js and AWS Systems.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">When I'm not busy geeking out over tech, I love hanging out with my friends, family and my little man Theo. I really love to be outside; either walking my dog or roller blading whenever I get the chance. I also enjoy catching up on the latest news from around the globe and getting lost in all sorts of TV shows. Don't be shy to hit me up on any platform you find me on—I'm always up for a chat! Thanks for stopping by my page; it really means a lot to me! </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Right now, I'm working at Nielsen as a Software Automation Engineer, and I'm loving every minute of it! </p>
