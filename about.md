<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span><strong>About Me</strong></span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My family's roots trace back to Mombasa, Kenya, where both of my parents were born and raised. My older sister, Sayona, was also born thereâ€”we have a five-year age gap. Thanks to the Diversity Visa Lottery program, my parents were able to immigrate to the United States; my mother received her green card through the program, and my father eventually obtained his after several years of persistence. As the first generation in my family to be born and raised in America, I'm deeply grateful for their journey. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1999, I grew up in the nearby city of Weston. My parents' hard work and dedication provided me with an incredible childhood. Throughout my life, I've been fortunate enough to immerse myself in diverse cultures and connect with truly amazing people!</p>
