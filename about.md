<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>About Me!</u></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My family originally emigrated from Mombasa, Kenya. Both my parents were born and raised in Mombasa. My older sister by 5 years was also born there. My parents were able to move to the United States through a visa lottery. </p>
<p>I was born in Miami, Florida in the year 1999. I was raised in Weston, Florida. I am the first generation from anyone in my family to have been born and raised in America. I have had an incredible childhood thanks to the opportunity that my parents have provided me.</p>
<p>Throughout my life, I have been blessed enough to experience many different cultures and communicate with really amazing people!</p>
